My main focus right now is web development with frameworks like Svelte and React, design and building (terminal) applications with TypeScript and Node.js/Bun. I've also built terminal applications with Rust and games. In the future I want to build more games and learn a more low-level programming language like C and other general computer science concepts.

I'm part of [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) where teens gather to code together. I really like open source and occasionally contribute to it when I feel like it :)

I also cook and ride my mountain bike occasionally.

### I'm proficient with the following skills and languages

### Check this out if you want a quick overview of what I'm doing!
- [StudyMate](https://github.com/thatfrogdev/studymate): a pomodoro timer extension for your browser if you get distracted fast (mvp, not really a main focus right now but it looks pretty cool!)
- [Drempal](https://swiftdust.itch.io/drempal-2): A revamped version of the game Drempal I've worked on before for Game Off 2025
- [Notabena (old)](https://github.com/The-Notabena-Organization/notabena-public-archive): I started this project as a terminal application for quick note-taking. Now someone else took over the idea to make it a great note-taking app (I'm not involved in this anymore)
  

### What I'm currently working on
- Doing stuff in the Hack Club community
- Building my own website, you can find it when it's done at m4rt.nl (will also have a portfolio with all of my finished projects)
- Learning new skills (like thinking more like a programmer, reading documentation, etc.) and languages sometimes

  - Contributing to and making my own games in Python, Godot and GDevelop. A few examples that I contributed to are [Project: SCP](https://github.com/starstriker112/projectscp), [Solitude](https://https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023/rate/2397851) and a few more games that aren't on GitHub. I made [Drempal](https://github.com/SwiftDust) myself and some more games using Godot and Python. I also contributed to [DS Game Engine](https://github.com/dark-snake-games/dark-snake-engine) and to [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine)
  - Contributing to [Sokora](https://github.com/sokoradesu), a bot to make managing a community easier on Discord (I used Discord before to find other people that code too; now I don't use it anymore)
  - Occasionally working on and contributing to some open source projects
