I'm part of [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) where teens gather to code together. I really like open source.

I also cook and ride my mountain bike occasionally.

### I'm proficient with the following skills and languages
<a align="center">[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=windows,linux,git,github,powershell,bash,js,ts,py,html,css,svelte,tailwind,nodejs,bun,figma,vscode,neovim)](https://skillicons.dev)</a>

### Check this out if you want a quick overview of what I'm doing!
- [StudyMate](https://github.com/thatfrogdev/studymate): a pomodoro timer extension for your browser if you get distracted fast
- [Drempal](https://github.com/thatfrogdev/drempal): a fun little game where you dodge the knives (prototyped in ~48 hours, don't expect too much)
- [Notabena (old)](https://github.com/The-Notabena-Organization/notabena-public-archive): I started this project as a terminal application for quick note-taking. Now someone else took over the idea to make it a great note-taking app (I'm not involved in this anymore)
  

### What I'm currently working on
- StudyMate
- Doing stuff in the Hack Club community
- Building my own website (you can find it when it's done at m4rt.nl (will also have a portfolio with all of my finished projects)
- Learning new skills (like thinking more like a programmer, reading documentation, etc.) and languages sometimes

  - Contributing to and making my own games in Python, Godot and GDevelop. A few examples that I contributed to are [Project: SCP](https://github.com/starstriker112/projectscp), [Solitude](https://https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023/rate/2397851) and a few more games that aren't on GitHub. I made [Drempal](https://github.com/SwiftDust) myself and some more games using Godot and Python. I also contributed to [DS Game Engine](https://github.com/dark-snake-games/dark-snake-engine) and to [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine)
  - Contributing to [Sokora](https://github.com/sokoradesu), a bot to make managing a community easier on Discord (I used Discord before to find other people that code too; now I don't use it anymore)
  - Occasionally working on and contributing to some open source projects
